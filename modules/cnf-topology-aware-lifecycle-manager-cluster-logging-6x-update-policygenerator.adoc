= Removing Cluster Logging Operator artifacts with {policy-gen-cr} CRs

When you update to Cluster Logging Operator version 6.x from version 5.x, you must add a cleanup policy that removes the old Operator artifacts from deployed clusters after creating the new API custom resources (CRs).

.Procedure

. Add the `acm-group-du-clo5-cleanup.yaml` file to the git repository that contains your other `PolicyGenerator` CRs.

<1> Default value is `11`. Ensure that the wave of `group-du-sno-clo5-cleanup` policy is after the `group-du-sno` configuration policy, which is wave `10` by default.

. Update the binding rules in the the `acm-group-du-clo5-cleanup.yaml` file as needed to match the labels in use for the associated fleet of clusters.

. Add the `acm-group-du-clo5-cleanup.yaml` line to the `generators` section in the `kustomization.yaml` file.

. Commit the changes, and then push to their git repository.

. Wait for ArgoCD to generate and sync the cleanup policy to the hub cluster.

.Verification

. Verify that the cleanup policy is bound to all clusters that upgraded from Cluster Logging Operator version 5.x to 6.x.

. Verify that the cleanup policy wave is after the `group-du-sno` configuration policy.
