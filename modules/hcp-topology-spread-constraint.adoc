= Spreading node pool VMs by using topologySpreadConstraint

By default, KubeVirt virtual machines (VMs) created by a node pool are scheduled on any available nodes that have the capacity to run the VMs. By default, the `topologySpreadConstraint` constraint is set to schedule VMs on multiple nodes.

In some scenarios, node pool VMs might run on the same node, which can cause availability issues. To avoid distribution of VMs on a single node, use the descheduler to continuously honour the `topologySpreadConstraint` constraint to spread VMs on multiple nodes.

.Prerequisites

* You installed the {descheduler-operator}. For more information, see "Installing the descheduler".

.Procedure

* Open the `KubeDescheduler` custom resource (CR) by entering the following command, and then modify the `KubeDescheduler` CR to use the `SoftTopologyAndDuplicates` profile so that you maintain the `topologySpreadConstraint` constraint settings.
+
The `KubeDescheduler` CR named `cluster` runs in the `openshift-kube-descheduler-operator` namespace.

----
<1> Sets the number of seconds between the descheduler running cycles.
<2> This profile evicts pods that follow the soft topology constraint: `whenUnsatisfiable: ScheduleAnyway`.
<3> By default, the {descheduler-operator} prevents the pod eviction with persistent volume claims (PVCs). Use this profile to allow eviction of pods with PVCs.
<4> By default, pods with local storage are not eligible for eviction. Use this profile to allow eviction of your VMs that use the local storage.
<5> You must use this setting when performing a live migration so that the descheduler runs in the background during the migration process.
