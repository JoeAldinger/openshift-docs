== Known issues

* When you forward logs to a syslog output, the produced message format is inconsistent between Fluentd and Vector log collectors. Vector messages are within quotation marks; Fluentd messages are not. As a consequence, when migrating from Fluentd to Vector, users might experience issues with their tool integrations.  (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-7007[LOG-7007])
