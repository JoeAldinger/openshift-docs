= Example address pool configurations

The following examples show address pool configurations for specific scenarios.

== Example: IPv4 and CIDR ranges

You can specify a range of IP addresses in classless inter-domain routing (CIDR) notation. You can combine CIDR notation with the notation that uses a hyphen to separate lower and upper bounds.

[source,yaml]

apiVersion: metallb.io/v1beta1
kind: IPAddressPool
metadata:
  name: doc-example-cidr
  namespace: metallb-system
spec:
  addresses:
  - 192.168.100.0/24
  - 192.168.200.0/24
  - 192.168.255.1-192.168.255.5
# ...

== Example: Assign IP addresses

You can set the `autoAssign` field to `false` to prevent MetalLB from automatically assigning IP addresses from the address pool. You can then assign a single IP address or multiple IP addresses from an IP address pool. To assign an IP address, append the `/32` CIDR notation to the target IP address in the `spec.addresses` parameter. This setting ensures that only the specific IP address is avilable for assignment, leaving non-reserved IP addresses for application use.

  autoAssign: false

[NOTE]
====
When you add a service, you can request a specific IP address from the address pool or you can specify the pool name in an annotation to request any IP address from the pool.
====

== Example: IPv4 and IPv6 addresses

You can add address pools that use IPv4 and IPv6. You can specify multiple ranges in the `addresses` list, just like several IPv4 examples.

Whether the service is assigned a single IPv4 address, a single IPv6 address, or both is determined by how you add the service. The `spec.ipFamilies` and `spec.ipFamilyPolicy` fields control how IP addresses are assigned to the service.
