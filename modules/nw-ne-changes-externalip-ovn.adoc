= Understanding changes in external IP behavior with OVN-Kubernetes

When migrating from OpenShift SDN to OVN-Kubernetes (OVN-K), services that use external IPs may become inaccessible across namespaces due to `NetworkPolicy` enforcement.

In OpenShift SDN, external IPs were accessible across namespaces by default. However, in OVN-K, network policies strictly enforce multitenant isolation, preventing access to services exposed via external IPs from other namespaces.

To ensure accessibility, consider the following alternatives:

* Use an ingress or route: Instead of exposing services using external IPs, configure an ingress or route to allow external access while maintaining security controls.

* Adjust `NetworkPolicies`: Modify `NetworkPolicy` rules to explicitly allow access from required namespaces. Ensure that your policies do not unintentionally block cross-namespace communication.

* Use a `LoadBalancer` service: If applicable, deploy a `LoadBalancer` service instead of relying on external IPs.

For more information on configuring NetworkPolicies, see "Configuring NetworkPolicies".
