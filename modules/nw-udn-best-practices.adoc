= Best practices for UserDefinedNetwork

Before setting up a `UserDefinedNetwork` (UDN) resource, users should consider the following information:

* To eliminate errors and ensure connectivity to services, you should create a namespace scoped UDN CR, create pods in the namespace and then create services in that namespace.

* `Openshift-*` namespaces should not be used to set up a udn.

* You might want to allow access to any Kubernetes services on the cluster default  network. By default, KAPI and DNS are accessible.

// May be something that is downstream only.
//* No active primary UDN managed pod can also be a candidate for `v1.multus-cni.io/default-network`

* Ensure tenants are using the `UserDefinedNetwork` resource and not `network-attachement-definitions` resource.This can create security risks between tenants.

* When configuring pod IP addresses the CIDR cannot overlap with the default cluster CIDR used by the cluster default network. OVN-Kubernetes network plugin uses the following address for the default network: 100.64.0.0/16, 169.254.169.0/29, 100.88.0.0/16, fd98::/64, fd69::/125, and fd97::/64.

* The default network’s podsubnet cannot be reused for any UDN.

* The default network’s joinsubnet cannot be reused for any UDN.

* You should not change pod IPAM annotations.

* The `Primary` network `role` is supported for UDN in {product-version}.
