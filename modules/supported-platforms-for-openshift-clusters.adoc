|====
1. For installer-provisioned infrastructure: All machines, including the computer that you run the installation process on, must have direct internet access to pull images for platform containers and provide telemetry data to Red{nbsp}Hat.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
After installation, the following changes are not supported:

* Mixing cloud provider platforms.
* Mixing cloud provider components. For example, using a persistent storage framework from a another platform on the platform where you installed the cluster.
====

2. For user-provisioned infrastructure: Depending on the supported cases for the platform, you can perform installations on user-provisioned infrastructure so that you can run machines with full internet access, place your cluster behind a proxy, or perform a disconnected installation.
+
In a disconnected installation, you can download the images that are required to install a cluster, place them in a mirror registry, and use that data to install your cluster. While you require internet access to pull images for platform containers, with a disconnected installation on vSphere or bare-metal infrastructure, your cluster machines do not require direct internet access.

3. For {rh-openstack-first}: The latest {product-title} release supports both the latest {rh-openstack} long-life release and intermediate release. For complete {rh-openstack} release compatibility, see the link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/4679401[{product-title} on {rh-openstack} support matrix].

The link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/4128421[{product-title} 4.x Tested Integrations] page contains details about integration testing for different platforms.
