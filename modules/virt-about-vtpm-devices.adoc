= About vTPM devices

A virtual Trusted Platform Module (vTPM) device functions like a
physical Trusted Platform Module (TPM) hardware chip.

You can use a vTPM device with any operating system, but Windows 11 requires
the presence of a TPM chip to install or boot. A vTPM device allows VMs created
from a Windows 11 image to function without a physical TPM chip.

If you do not enable vTPM, then the VM does not recognize a TPM device, even if
the node has one.

A vTPM device also protects virtual machines by storing secrets without physical hardware. {VirtProductName} supports persisting vTPM device state by using Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs) for VMs. You must specify the storage class to be used by the PVC by setting the `vmStateStorageClass` attribute in the `HyperConverged` custom resource (CR).

In {VirtProductName}, if the `storageClass` for `vmStateStorageClass` is not explicitly defined, the system uses the cluster's default storage class to create the vTPM PVC. The access mode for the PVC is determined by the storage profile of the storage class.

[IMPORTANT]
====
VMs with vTPM devices that use a ReadWriteOnce (RWO) volume are non-migratable. To enable live migration, the underlying storage class for the vTPM PVC must support the ReadWriteMany (RWX) access mode.

The storage class must be of type `Filesystem` and support the `ReadWriteMany` (RWX) access mode.
