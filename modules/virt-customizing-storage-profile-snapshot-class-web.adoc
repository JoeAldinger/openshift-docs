= Specifying a volume snapshot class by using the web console

If you are creating a snapshot of a VM, a warning appears if the storage class of the disk has more than one volume snapshot class associated with it. In this case, you must specify one volume snapshot class; otherwise, any disk that has more than one volume snapshot class is excluded from the snapshots list.

You can specify the default volume snapshot class in the {product-title} web console.
