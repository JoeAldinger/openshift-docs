= Hot plugging CPUs on a virtual machine

You can increase or decrease the number of CPU sockets allocated to a virtual machine (VM) without having to restart the VM by using the {product-title} web console.

.Procedure

. Navigate to *Virtualization* -> *VirtualMachines*.
. Select the required VM to open the *VirtualMachine details* page.
. On the *Configuration* tab, click *Edit CPU|Memory*.
. Select the *vCPU* radio button.
. Enter the desired number of vCPU sockets and click *Save*.

[NOTE]
====
* You can apply memory hot-plug changes immediately by using an automatic migration. If the live migration is not triggered, you must restart the VM. You can adjust this behavior cluster-wide by using the `maxHotplugRatio` parameter or override it in your VM.
* By default, you can hot-plug a VM with up to 4 times its initial CPU or memory configuration. For example, a VM with 1 vCPU and 2 GiB memory can scale up to 4 vCPUs and 8 GiB before a restart is needed. You can adjust this behavior cluster-wide by using the `maxHotplugRatio` parameter or override it in your VM.
