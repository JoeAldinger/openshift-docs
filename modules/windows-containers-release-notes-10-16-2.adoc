== Bug fixes

* Previously, Windows nodes were unable to pull from image mirror registries if an organization name or namespace was included in the source of the `ImageTagMirrorSet` (ITMS) object. With this fix, you can include an organization name or namespace in the `ITMS` object. With this change, additional guidelines and requirements around using mirror registries have been added to the {product-title} documentation. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-55787[*OCPBUGS-55787*])
// The "additional guidelines and requirements" are forthcoming in https://github.com/openshift/openshift-docs/pull/93939
