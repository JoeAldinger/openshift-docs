=== WMCO now defaults to info-level logging
The WMCO is configured to use the `info` log level by default. You can change the log level to `debug` by editing the WMCO subscription object. 
// Based on https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WINC-1345

For more information, see _Configuring debug-level logging for the Windows Machine Config Operator_.

== Bug fixes

* Previously, Windows nodes were unable to pull from image mirror registries if an organization name or namespace was included in the source of the `ImageTagMirrorSet` (ITMS) object. With this fix, you can include an organization name or namespace in the `ITMS` object. With this change, additional guidelines and requirements around using mirror registries have been added to the {product-title} documentation. For more information, see _Using Windows containers with a mirror registry_. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-55915[*OCPBUGS-55915*])

* Previously, the {product-title} documentation lacked information about WMCO support for the installer-provisioned infrastructure (IPI) and the user-provisioned infrastructure (UPI) installation methods. With this fix, the documentation reports that the IPI method is the preferred installation method and can be used with all platforms. The UPI method is limited to specific use cases. For more information, see _WMCO supported installation method_. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-44237[*OCPBUGS-44237*])
