== Bug fixes

* Previously, Windows nodes were unable to pull from image mirror registries if an organization name or namespace was included in the source of the `ImageTagMirrorSet` (ITMS) object. With this fix, you can include an organization name or namespace in the `ITMS` object. With this change, additional guidelines and requirements around using mirror registries have been added to the {product-title} documentation.
