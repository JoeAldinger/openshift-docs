The OVN-Kubernetes CNI plugin supports `layer2`, `layer3`, and `localnet` topologies for secondary pod networks. However, for the primary network, or the main network that all pods are attached to, only a `layer3` topology is supported. This allows for network models where all pods in the cluster were part of the same global `layer3` network, but restricts the ability to customize primary network configurations.

With user-defined networks, cluster administrators and users are offered highly customizable network configuration options that provide users with the ability to define their own network topologies, ensure network isolation, manage IP addressing for the workloads, and leverage advanced networking features. User-defined networks help enhance networking flexibility, security, and performance.
