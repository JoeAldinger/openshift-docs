The following sections explain how to create and manage secondary networks using the `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` (NAD) resource.

== Approaches to managing a secondary network

You can manage the life cycle of a secondary network created by NAD with one of the following two approaches:

* By modifying the Cluster Network Operator (CNO) configuration. With this method, the CNO automatically creates and manages the `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` object. In addition to managing the object lifecycle, the CNO ensures that a DHCP is available for a secondary network that uses a DHCP assigned IP address.

* By applying a YAML manifest. With this method, you can manage the secondary network directly by creating an `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` object. This approach allows for the invocation of multiple CNI plugins in order to attach secondary network interfaces in a pod.

Each approach is mutually exclusive and you can only use one approach for managing a secondary network at a time. For either approach, the secondary network is managed by a Container Network Interface (CNI) plugin that you configure.

[NOTE]
====
When deploying {product-title} nodes with multiple network interfaces on {rh-openstack-first} with OVN SDN, DNS configuration of the secondary interface might take precedence over the DNS configuration of the primary interface. In this case, remove the DNS nameservers for the subnet ID that is attached to the secondary interface by running the following command:

[source,terminal]
----
$ openstack subnet set --dns-nameserver 0.0.0.0 <subnet_id>
