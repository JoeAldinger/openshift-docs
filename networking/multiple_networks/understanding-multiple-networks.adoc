You can create additional user-defined networks by using the `UserDefinedNetwork` (UDN) custom resource. With user-defined networks, cluster administrators and users are offered highly customizable network configuration options. For more information, see xref:../../networking/multiple_networks/primary_networks/about-user-defined-networks.adoc#about-user-defined-networks[About user-defined networks]

Alternatively, You can define more than one additional network using the `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` (NAD) custom resource for your cluster. In Kubernetes, container networking is delegated to networking plugins that implement the Container Network Interface (CNI). {product-title} uses the Multus CNI plugin to allow chaining of CNI plugins. During cluster installation, you configure your _default_ pod network. The default network handles all ordinary network traffic for the cluster. You can define an _additional network_ based on the available CNI plugins and attach
one or more of these networks to your pods. Depending on your needs, this gives you flexibility when you configure pods that deliver network functionality, such as switching or routing.

== Additional networks in {product-title}

{product-title} provides the following CNI plugins for creating additional
networks in your cluster:

* *bridge*: xref:../../networking/multiple_networks/secondary_networks/creating-secondary-nwt-other-cni.adoc#nw-multus-bridge-object_configuring-additional-network-cni[Configure a bridge-based additional network] to allow pods on the same host to communicate with each other and the host.

* *host-device*: xref:../../networking/multiple_networks/secondary_networks/creating-secondary-nwt-other-cni.adoc#nw-multus-host-device-object_configuring-additional-network-cni[Configure a host-device additional network] to allow pods access to a physical Ethernet network device on the host system.

* *ipvlan*: xref:../../networking/multiple_networks/secondary_networks/creating-secondary-nwt-other-cni.adoc#nw-multus-ipvlan-object_configuring-additional-network-cni[Configure an ipvlan-based additional network] to allow pods on a host to communicate with other hosts and pods on those hosts, similar to a macvlan-based additional network. Unlike a macvlan-based additional network, each pod shares the same MAC address as the parent physical network interface.

* *vlan*: xref:../../networking/multiple_networks/secondary_networks/creating-secondary-nwt-other-cni.adoc#nw-multus-vlan-object_configuring-additional-network-cni[Configure a VLAN-based additional network] to allow VLAN-based network isolation and connectivity for pods.

* *macvlan*: xref:../../networking/multiple_networks/secondary_networks/creating-secondary-nwt-other-cni.adoc#nw-multus-macvlan-object_configuring-additional-network-cni[Configure a macvlan-based additional network] to allow pods on a host to communicate with other hosts and pods on those hosts by using a physical network interface. Each pod that is attached to a macvlan-based additional network is provided a unique MAC address.

* *TAP*: xref:../../networking/multiple_networks/secondary_networks/creating-secondary-nwt-other-cni.adoc#nw-multus-tap-object_configuring-additional-network-cni[Configure a TAP-based additional network] to create a tap device inside the container namespace. A TAP device enables user space programs to send and receive network packets.

* *SR-IOV*: xref:../../networking/hardware_networks/about-sriov.adoc#about-sriov[Configure an SR-IOV based additional network] to allow pods to attach to a virtual function (VF) interface on SR-IOV capable hardware on the host system.
