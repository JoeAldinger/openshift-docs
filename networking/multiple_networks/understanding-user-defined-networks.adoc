The OVN-Kubernetes network plugin has traditionally supported layer 2, layer 3, and localnet network types for secondary interfaces, but limited primary networks to a single layer 3 topology. This allowed for network models where all pods shared the same network topology, but restricted the ability to customize primary network configurations.

With user-defined networks, cluster administrators and users are offered highly customizable network configuration options that provide users with the ability to define their own network topologies, ensure network isolation, manage IP addressing, and leverage advanced networking features. User-defined networks help enhance networking flexibility, security, and scalability. 

User-defined networks provide the following benefits:

. Enhanced network isolation
+
* **Tenant isolation**: Namespaces can have their own isolated primary network, similar to how tenants are isolated in {rh-openstack-first}. This improves security by reducing the risk of cross-tenant traffic.
* **Layer 2 and layer 3 support**: Cluster administrators can configure primary networks as layer 2 or layer 3 network types. This provides the flexibility of a secondary network to the primary network.

. Simplified network management
+
* **Reduced network configuration complexity**: With user-defined networks, complex network isolation policies are eliminated, making it easier for cluster administrators to scale and manage networks.
* **Consistent IP addressing**: Users can specify and reuse IP subnets across different namespaces and clusters, providing a consistent networking environment.

. Improved network security
+
* **Native isolation**: Provides a native way to isolate network tenants, which reduces the reliance on complex network policies.

. Scalability
+
* **Support for multiple networks**: The user-defined networking feature allows administrators to connect multiple namespaces to a single network, or to create distinct networks for different sets of namespaces. 

. Optimized traffic handling
+
* **Enhanced routing efficiency**: With 
* **North/south network traffic support**: Improves connectivity with services outside of the cluster by adding support for external traffic to and from pods.

. Ingress and egress support
+
* **Support for ingress and egress traffic**: Cluster ingress and egress traffic is supported for both primary and secondary networks.
* **Support for ingress and egress features**: User-defined networks support support the following ingress and egress features:
+
** EgressQoS
** EgressService
** EgressIP
** Load balancer and NodePort services, as well as services with external IPs.

. Simplification of application migration from {rh-openstack-first}
+
* **Network parity**: With user-defined networking, the migration of applications from OpenStack to {product-title} is simplified by providing similar network isolation and configuration options.
