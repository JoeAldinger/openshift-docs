====
Before you acknowledge the update, verify that you are not using any of the Kubernetes APIs that are removed from the version you are updating to.
For example, in {product-title} 4.17, there are no API removals.
See "Kubernetes API removals" for more information.
====

.Prerequisites

* You have verified that APIs for all of the applications running on your cluster are compatible with the next Y-stream release of {product-title}.
For more details about compatibility, see "Verifying cluster API versions between update versions".

.Procedure

* Complete the administrative acknowledgment to start the cluster update by running the following command:
+
--
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm upgrade
----

If the cluster update does not complete successfully, more details about the update failure are provided in the `Reason` and `Message` sections.

.Example output

  Reason: MultipleReasons
  Message: Cluster should not be upgraded between minor versions for multiple reasons: AdminAckRequired,ResourceDeletesInProgress
  * Kubernetes 1.29 and therefore OpenShift 4.16 remove several APIs which require admin consideration. Please see the knowledge article https://access.redhat.com/articles/7031404 for details and instructions.

.Verification

* Verify the update by running the following command:
+
--
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get configmap admin-acks -n openshift-config -o json | jq .data
----

.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
{
  "ack-4.14-kube-1.28-api-removals-in-4.15": "true",
  "ack-4.15-kube-1.29-api-removals-in-4.16": "true"
}
----

[NOTE]
====
In this example, the cluster is updated from version 4.14 to 4.15, and then from 4.15 to 4.16 in a Control Plane Only update.
