The release notes for Red{nbsp}Hat OpenShift for Windows Containers tracks the development of the Windows Machine Config Operator (WMCO), which provides all Windows container workload capabilities in {product-title}.

[id="about-windows-containers-numbering"]
== Windows Machine Config Operator numbering

Y-stream releases of the WMCO are in step with {product-title}, with only z-stream releases between {product-title} releases. The WMCO numbering reflects the associated {product-title} version in the y-stream position. For example, the current release of WMCO is associated with {product-title} version 4.16. Thus, the numbering is WMCO 10.16.z.
